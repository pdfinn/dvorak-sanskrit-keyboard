# Sanskrit (Dvorak) Keyboard Layout for Mac OS

This custom keyboard layout maps the Dvorak keyboard layout to Sanskrit characters. The mapping is based on rough phonetic similarity between the Dvorak keys and Sanskrit characters. You may need to adjust the layout according to your preferences or specific typing requirements.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the `Sanskrit(Dvorak).keylayout` file to your computer.

2. Create a new folder named `Sanskrit(Dvorak)` and place the `Sanskrit(Dvorak).keylayout` file inside it.

3. Copy the `Sanskrit(Dvorak)` folder to the following location: /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ or for a single user installation, copy it to: ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/

If the `Keyboard Layouts` folder does not exist, create it.

4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5. After restarting, go to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Input Sources`.

6. Click the "+" button at the bottom left of the Input Sources window to add a new input source.

7. In the search bar, type "Sanskrit (Dvorak)" to find the custom keyboard layout.

8. Select the "Sanskrit (Dvorak)" layout from the search results and click "Add".

9. You should now see the "Sanskrit (Dvorak)" layout in your list of input sources. To switch to the new layout, use the Input menu in the menu bar or the keyboard shortcut (usually `Control` + `Space` or `Command` + `Space`, depending on your system settings).

## Usage

Once you have the "Sanskrit (Dvorak)" layout selected, the keys on your Dvorak keyboard will generate the corresponding Sanskrit characters as defined in the `Sanskrit(Dvorak).keylayout` file.

Please note that this layout is designed for use with a physical Dvorak keyboard or a Dvorak layout configured in your operating system.

## Troubleshooting

If the custom keyboard layout is not working as expected, make sure you have followed the installation instructions correctly and have selected the "Sanskrit (Dvorak)" layout in the Input Sources settings.

If you still experience issues, please check if the `Sanskrit(Dvorak).keylayout` file is saved with the correct file extension and that it is placed in the correct folder. Ensure that the file and folder names are accurate.
